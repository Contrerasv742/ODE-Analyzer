# ODE Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates understanding of several key concepts in Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) through an interactive Python application. The program allows users to visualize and analyze three different types of ODEs:

1. First-Order Autonomous ODEs
2. Second-Order Homogeneous ODEs
3. Two-Dimensional Systems of ODEs

## Learning Objectives Demonstrated

### 1. First-Order Autonomous ODEs
- Implementation of phase line analysis for 1D autonomous ODEs
- Demonstration of long-term behavior prediction
- Application of Euler's method for numerical approximation
- Visualization of solution trajectories
- Understanding of equilibrium points and stability

Example: Logistic Growth Model
```python
dx/dt = rx(1 - x/K)
```
where:
- r is the growth rate
- K is the carrying capacity
- x is the population size

### 2. Second-Order Homogeneous ODEs with Constant Coefficients
- Conversion of second-order ODEs to systems of first-order ODEs
- Analysis of different solution types:
  * Underdamped solutions
  * Critically damped solutions
  * Overdamped solutions
- Implementation of analytical solutions
- Visualization of solution behavior

Example: Spring-Mass System
```python
mx'' + cx' + kx = 0
```
where:
- m is the mass
- c is the damping coefficient
- k is the spring constant
- x is the displacement

### 3. Two-Dimensional Systems of Linear ODEs
- Analysis of systems with real eigenvalues
- Analysis of systems with complex eigenvalues
- Demonstration of phase plane behavior
- Implementation of eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations
- Visualization of solution trajectories

Example System:
```python
dx/dt = ax + by
dy/dt = cx + dy
```
where a, b, c, d are constant coefficients
